                        Things move with gentle steadiness on Surface, the new EP from Minneapolis producer su na, the alias of Alec Ness. It’s a patient, futuristic R&B record that’s so immersive, it borders on synesthetic. Like a camera’s image coming into focus, blurry chordal backgrounds change into sharp lines just as the moment’s right, and Surface does prove to be a snapshot of very, very deep things. On Surface, su na delivers six new beautifully dense songs that blend hip-hop with glassy soul. Opener “Tell Me” unfurls like dawn over a sleepy city, while closing track “Essex” sways like it’s had one-too-many drinks.

                        su na began experimenting with this brand of shadowy R&B in 2013, and in only a short time has been featured on BBC Radio 1, Apple Music Beats 1, and tastemaker collective Majestic Casual. He’s released a steady stream of singles and official remixes for GoldLink, Gallant and JOY. su na is once again working with talented company. “Tell Me” features a come-hither hook from Chicago singer Ravyn Lenae, while Dizzy Fae lends her moody voice to “Complexion.” The stormy hip-hop cut “Exotic” invites London MC Lord Apex to drop rapid bars over tempered steel drums. Flight Facilities collaborator Christine Hoberg muses about modern forms of distance on “Depart.”</p>

                        su na’s detailed beats and fulsome chords are what brings it all together, and onSurface his music reaches a new level of polish and power. It’s music for wandering the streets alone; it’s music for waking up together. su na plays with ideas of passion, longing, and release, and Surface is a record that demands day-long repeat listens. Like Ta-Ku and Mr. Carmack, su na proves that digitally-produced future R&B can beat with a human heart.</p>
