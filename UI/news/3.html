                        Drum Machine Designer by Apple’s Logic Pro X comes with a complete set of presets that sound great. But let’s face it, there’s always room for more drum kits. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to build a custom drum kit in Drum Machine Designer using whatever samples you like. We’ll also look at how save it into a preset and recall it easily for future use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Your first step is to find the sounds you want to use in your kit. We of course recommend using Splice Sounds, an easily-searchable library of high-quality samples from providers such as Loopmasters, Black Octopus, Prime Loops and from artists like deadmau5, Just Blaze, KRNE, Medasin, and more. Here’s how to find samples for your custom kit using Splice Sounds.</p>
                        <p>
                        With Splice Sounds, you can search for samples by instruments categories and genres and filter by key and BPM. In this example, we’ll find sounds for our funk kit by choosing “funk” as a genre, narrowing the scope to drums and kicks, and filtering further by clicking the “one-shots” icon so that our search doesn’t turn up any loops.</p>
                        <p>
                        Setup a new software instrument track in Logic X. Navigate to the inspector window, and under “instrument”, click on Drum Machine Designer. When Drum Machine Designer initializes, select the preset Empty Kit to clear out the drum cells.</p>
                        <p>
                        Drum Machine Designer’s interface allows easy editing of your samples. You can tweak anything from, attack, decay, pitch, filters, drive, reverb and much more. Simply click on the sample, and make your adjustments. Additionally, you can change the icons of each drum cell by right clicking on the current icon.</p>
                        <p>
                        After adding your samples and tweaking your kit, you’re ready to save the kit as a preset for future use. Click on the “save” button at the bottom right of the inspector window. You’ll be prompted to choose where you’d like to save your kit. I recommend creating a new folder for saving custom Drum Machine Designer presets. Once saved, you can easily recall your presets from the Logic’s inspector window.</p>
